# Ramesh-2021
Repositiory for code used in pre-print "Nutritional dependence of sperm mitochondrial metabolism and small RNA biogenesis"

This repository contains code used in the publication "Nutritional dependence of sperm mitochondrial metabolism and small RNA biogenesis" by Ramesh et. al., found in pre-print format here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.20.465156v1

The code contains the workflow for both proteomic analyses as well as small non-coding RNA sequencing analysis performed in manuscript. 
Most of the RNA-seq analysis builds on our previous work Seqpac - a workflow primarily built for small RNA sequencing. 

If you are using any code or data from this repository, please cite doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.20.465156 
If you are interested in sRNA analysis workflows I strongly suggest you check out our vignette for Seqpac here at GitHub, found here
