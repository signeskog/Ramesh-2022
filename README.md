Repositiory for code used in publication ""

This repository contains code used in the publication "" by Ramesh et. al., published:
""

The code contains the workflow for both proteomic analyses as well as small non-coding RNA sequencing analysis performed in manuscript. 
Most of the RNA-seq analysis builds on our previous work Seqpac - a workflow primarily built for small RNA sequencing. 

If you are using any code or data from this repository, please cite ""
If you are interested in sRNA analysis workflows I strongly suggest you check out our vignette for Seqpac here at GitHub, found here
